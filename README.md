- **Evaluating Models’ Local Decision Boundaries via Contrast Sets**. 
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02709.pdf) 
[[Code]](https://allennlp.org/contrast-sets)<br>
Descrption: Contrast sets provide a local view of a model's decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model's true linguistic capabilities. This paper proposed a new annotation paradigm for NLP to generate contrast samples.
