- **Evaluating Models’ Local Decision Boundaries via Contrast Sets** 
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02709.pdf) 
[[Code]](https://allennlp.org/contrast-sets)<br>
Descrption: Contrast sets provide a local view of a model's decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model's true linguistic capabilities. This paper proposed a new annotation paradigm for NLP to generate contrast samples. 

- **Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification With In-domain Contrastive Learning** 
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02943.pdf)<br>
Descrption: This paper applies two data augmentation methods, i.e., synonym subtituion and back translation, to define pretext taks in contrastive learning.
